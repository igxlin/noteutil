# Noteutil

A tool to help filter notes. So far I only use it personally. Thus the
API is unstable and there will be refactor from time to time. Use it at
your own risk.

## Usage

List periodic journals:

```bash
# List weekly journal of today
noteutil ls --journal-only --date today --period weekly
```
